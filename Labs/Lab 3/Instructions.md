# Lab 3 - Shiny

I am an annoying client. I want an application to see emergency services stays.

I want to see:
- The full table
- Multiple graphs
- At least one 3D graph because it looks cool

I want to be able to filter depending on these groups:
- Everybody
- People over 75
- People under 18

Make it pretty.
