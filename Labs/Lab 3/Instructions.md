# Lab 3 - Shiny

I am an annoying client. I want an application to see emergency services stays.

I want to see:
- The full table
- Multiple graphs
    - About ALD
    - About costs
- At least one 3D graph because it looks cool

I want to know about the factors associated with staying at least 6 hours in a service.

I want to be able to filter depending on these groups:
- Everybody
- People over 75
- People under 18
- All emergency services
- Only one emergency service
- All regions
- One region

Make it pretty.
